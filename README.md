# Portfolio Project

Welcome to the Portfolio Project.

This is an example of a modern website, using a "static site generator,"
a JavaScript system that generates a webpage that can be hosted easily online.

For this project, we have some learning goals and some basic requirements.

## Goals

- Build a published portfolio where they can highlight their coding work.
- Learn about the fundamentals of how a website is designed.
- Learn how to use open source libraries to enhance their work.
- Learn the fundamentals of code reuse and the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
- Learn the basics of licensing models.

## Requirements
- Create a portfolio with at least 3 pages and a template you can expand as the course grows.
- Customize the look and feel of your page so it is unique.
- Use at least one library you researched independently to enhance your website.
- Include an "acknowledgements" page with a list of libraries and sources you used.
- Include a copyright statement with a license.

well.*
